# Metal-Separator-Machine
Industry Project- To build a machine which separates metal scrap coming from the shredder with less human efforts by help of different separation techniques.Prime objective of the project is to build a machine which separates metal scrap coming 
from the shredder with less human efforts by help of different separation techniques.
1) To Design the model of Metal Separator Mechanism.,
2) To Develop and Simulate working of Metal Separator Mechanism,
3) At last, to Manufacture and test the working of Metal Separator.

Machine takes Iron (Fe), Stainless Steel (SS), Aluminium (Al), Copper (Cu). These are the mostly used metals for any machine to manufacture. Machine separates all four metals in three stages.
From Shredder all the metals feed into the separator mechanism and further gets separated. Machine is separating Iron from simple magnetic separation technique. Similarly, SS 
will be separated by electromagnet method and in the last stage (3rd) we are separating Al & Cu by Eddy Current separation technique.
